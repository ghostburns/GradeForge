## Introduction
GradeForge is a comprehensive academic management system designed to streamline the process of managing student grades, subjects, and academic records. This documentation provides a detailed overview of the system's architecture, components, and functionality.

### Purpose
GradeForge serves as a centralized platform for:
- Managing student academic records
- Tracking subject grades and performance
- Generating comprehensive reports
- Maintaining academic history
- Facilitating data-driven decision making

### Target Users
- Academic administrators
- Teachers and instructors
- Student advisors
- Educational institutions

## System Architecture

### Overview
GradeForge is built using Python, implementing a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability. The system consists of several key components that work together to provide a seamless experience.

### Core Modules
1. **Student Management Module**
   - Handles student information
   - Manages academic records
   - Tracks performance history

2. **Subject Management Module**
   - Manages course information
   - Handles subject-specific data
   - Tracks academic requirements

3. **Grade Management Module**
   - Processes grade calculations
   - Manages grade history
   - Handles grade reporting

4. **Data Management Module**
   - Handles data persistence
   - Manages data import/export
   - Ensures data integrity

## Object-Oriented Design

### Design Principles
GradeForge follows SOLID principles and object-oriented design patterns:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - Clear separation of concerns between modules
   - Example: Student class handles only student-related operations

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Classes are open for extension but closed for modification
   - New features can be added without changing existing code
   - Example: Grade calculation methods can be extended without modifying core logic

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Derived classes can substitute their base classes
   - Maintains type safety and polymorphism
   - Example: Different types of grades can be substituted without breaking functionality

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Clients only depend on interfaces they use
   - Clean and focused interfaces
   - Example: Separate interfaces for grade calculation and reporting

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
   - Both depend on abstractions
   - Example: Data storage implementation is abstracted through interfaces

### Class Hierarchy

```
Base Classes
├── AcademicEntity (Abstract)
│   ├── Student
│   └── Subject
├── GradeCalculator (Abstract)
│   ├── StandardGradeCalculator
│   └── WeightedGradeCalculator
└── DataManager (Abstract)
    ├── JSONDataManager
    └── CSVDataManager
```

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Factory Pattern**
   - Creates objects without specifying exact class
   - Used for creating different types of grade calculators
   - Example: `GradeCalculatorFactory.create_calculator(type)`

2. **Observer Pattern**
   - Implements event handling for grade updates
   - Notifies relevant components of changes
   - Example: Grade changes notify student records

3. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Encapsulates different grade calculation algorithms
   - Allows runtime selection of calculation method
   - Example: Different grading schemes (percentage, letter, etc.)

4. **Repository Pattern**
   - Abstracts data persistence
   - Provides clean interface for data operations
   - Example: StudentRepository, GradeRepository

### Class Relationships

1. **Association**
   - Student has many Subjects
   - Subject has many Grades
   - Loose coupling between components

2. **Composition**
   - GradeCalculator is composed of CalculationStrategy
   - DataManager is composed of StorageStrategy

3. **Inheritance**
   - Specialized grade calculators inherit from base calculator
   - Different data managers inherit from base manager

### Encapsulation
- Private attributes with public methods
- Data validation in setters
- Controlled access to internal state
- Example: Grade validation before assignment

### Polymorphism
- Different grade calculation strategies
- Multiple data storage implementations
- Flexible reporting formats
