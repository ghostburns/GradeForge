# GradeForge - Student Grade Management System

GradeForge is a Python CLI-based application for managing student grades. It uses Object-Oriented Programming principles to model students, subjects, and grades, supporting different logic for High School and College students.

## Features

-   **Student Management**:
    -   Add new students (Generic, High School, or College types).
    -   `Student` class stores name, ID.
    -   `HighSchoolStudent` and `CollegeStudent` inherit from `Student` with specific grading logic.
        -   `CollegeStudent` includes a `major` attribute.
-   **Subject Management**:
    -   Define subjects with a name, code, and credit hours.
    -   Assign subjects to students. Each student enrollment gets a distinct instance of the subject.
    -   `Subject` class stores name, code, credit hours, and a list of grades.
-   **Grade Management**:
    -   Input grades for each subject per student.
    -   `Grade` class stores description (e.g., "Midterm"), a numeric score/point, and an optional letter grade.
    -   **High School Students**:
        -   Numeric marks (0-100).
        -   Pass/fail based on a 50% overall average.
    -   **College Students**:
        -   Letter grades (`A+`, `A`, `A-`, ..., `F`).
        -   Grade points assigned to letter grades (e.g., A/A+ = 4.0, F = 0.0).
        -   GPA calculation based on grade points and subject credit hours.
        -   Failing a course is indicated by an 'F' grade. Academic status considers GPA and F grades.
-   **Reporting**:
    -   Calculate and display subject-wise performance.
    -   Calculate overall average (for High School) or GPA (for College).
    -   Determine pass/fail status or academic standing.
    -   Generate detailed individual student reports.
-   **Data Persistence**:
    -   Save current session data (students, subjects, grades) to a JSON file (`gradeforge_data.json`).
    -   Load data from the JSON file upon application startup.
-   **Data Export**:
    -   Export all student data to a CSV file.
-   **CLI Interface**:
    -   Interactive menu-driven command-line interface.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following Python files:

-   `gradeforge.py`: Main application file containing the CLI logic, data management (`GradeForge` class), and interactions between different components.
-   `student.py`: Defines the base `Student` class and derived classes `HighSchoolStudent` and `CollegeStudent`. Includes logic for grade calculations specific to student types (overall average, GPA, pass/fail status).
-   `subject.py`: Defines the `Subject` class, which stores subject details (name, code, credit hours) and a list of associated `Grade` objects. It can calculate the average score/point for the subject.
-   `grade.py`: Defines the `Grade` class, representing an individual grade entry with a description, score (numeric mark or grade point), and an optional letter grade.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
-   `gradeforge_data.json`: (Generated at runtime) Stores the application data.
-   `*.csv`: (Generated by export feature) CSV exports of grade data.

## Object-Oriented Design

-   **`Grade`**: Represents a single assessment outcome.
-   **`Subject`**: Represents a course, containing multiple `Grade` objects and credit hour information.
-   **`Student`**: Base class for students. Manages a collection of `Subject` objects they are enrolled in.
    -   **`HighSchoolStudent` (inherits `Student`)**: Implements grading logic based on numeric marks and a simple average.
    -   **`CollegeStudent` (inherits `Student`)**: Implements grading logic based on letter grades, grade points, credit hours, and GPA.
-   **`GradeForge`**: Orchestrator class that manages collections of `Student` and template `Subject` objects, handles user interaction via the CLI, and manages data persistence and export.

Polymorphism is utilized, for example, in `generate_report()` and `get_overall_average()` methods, where the behavior adapts based on whether the object is a `HighSchoolStudent` or `CollegeStudent`.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Save all the Python files (`gradeforge.py`, `student.py`, `subject.py`, `grade.py`) in the same directory.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
4.  Run the application using the command:
    ```bash
    python gradeforge.py
    ```
5.  Follow the on-screen menu options to interact with the system.

No external libraries are required beyond standard Python libraries (`json`, `csv`, `os`).
